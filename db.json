            "inference": "MEDICAL ANIMATION TRANSCRIPT: Robotic surgery is a minimally invasive operation performed by surgeons manipulating robotic arms through several tiny incisions called ports. A robotic surgical machine consists of several main components including the console, where the surgeon sits while performing the operation, the patient-side cart with four interactive robotic arms and attached surgical instruments, and a high-definition 3D vision system. This system allows surgeons to make precise, controlled movements in your body with increased vision and dexterity. During robotic surgery, your surgeon will insert a high-definition 3D camera through one of the ports. The camera provides a magnified view of the surgical area. Then your surgeon will insert specialized surgical tools held by the remaining robotic arms through the other ports. Seated at the computer console, your surgeon will view the surgical area through a viewfinder and move the surgical tools and camera with joystick-like controls and foot pedals. Your surgeon's motions will generate computer input to guide the motion of the robot arms and surgical tools. Advantages of the system include controlled accurate movement of the surgical tools, prevention of unintentional hand shake or tremor, ability to operate in space is smaller than a human hand, enhanced visibility of the surgical area, and less patient blood loss and scarring."
